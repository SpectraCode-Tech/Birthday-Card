    <h1>🌸 Happy 50th Birthday, Mummy 🌸</h1>

    <p>Dearest Mother, today I thank Allah for blessing me with you. You have reached 50 years with grace and faith, and I pray that Allah continues to keep you strong, joyful, and surrounded by His mercy.</p>

    <p>May Allah protect you always, grant you good health, and keep your heart filled with peace. I ask Him to make every day ahead easier than the days behind, and to surround you with light and happiness.</p>

    <p>Mother, I pray that Allah increases you in wisdom, patience, and barakah in your time, wealth, and family. May He guide your steps on the straight path and make your life a source of blessing for all around you.</p>

    <p>I ask Allah to forgive your shortcomings, accept your good deeds, and grant you Jannah al‑Firdaws. May He make me a source of joy for you in this world and the next.</p>

    <p>On this special milestone, I pray that Allah makes your 50th year the beginning of a chapter filled with ease, happiness, and closeness to Him. May He bless you with many more years of love, iman, and serenity.</p>
